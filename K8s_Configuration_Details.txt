Cluster  ->  What do you mean by Cluster???

Node   ->   <Blue VM>

---
~/.oci/config file will contain all the OCIDs from the tenant

Since we used gse00014475, We copied Tenant, User, Compartment, Finger Print
into .oci/config file


Note: Cluster is created on gse00014475.  download the get-Kubeconfig file



To Create Kubeconfig,  you need to use get_kubeconfig file and run it
Note: get-kubeconfig.sh will reference ~/.oci/config file

# Assuming the file is in your home directory
chmod +x ~/get-kubeconfig.sh

# Export ENDPOINT which points to the region's api server
export ENDPOINT=containerengine.us-ashburn-1.oraclecloud.com

# Retrieve and save the kubeconfig
~/get-kubeconfig.sh ocid1.cluster.oc1.iad.aaaaaaaaaezdindgmuzdszjsga3tgmbvge2denjymu3tqzdegc3gioldhbrd > ~/kubeconfig



Download the Kubeconfig into your laptop.


# Use the kubeconfig with kubectl commands
export KUBECONFIG=~/kubeconfig  

export KUBECONFIG="C:\Anand\Education\Containers\LearningK8s\kubeconfig.txt"

Note:  Kubeconfig was generated from get_kubeconfig

> kubectl get nodes
